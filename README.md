Churn Modelling using Artificial Neural Network

The Dataset contains details of the Bank such as :

CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography (France / Spain/ Germany), Gender, Age, 
Tenure (Number of years with bank) , Balance, NumOfProducts (checkbook, CreditCard, etc),
HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, Exited (yes / No)

The ANN model is trying to predict of the Customer Exited the bank or stayed with the bank.

Dataset was splited into 80:20 ratio for training and testing

The ANN Model consists 4 layers:

1. Input layer and 
2. First Hidden Layer
3. Second Hidden Layer
4. Output Layer

Fitted the model with 20 epochs
Obtained Accuracy of 86.05%
